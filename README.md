# CFD-2D-NavierStokes
Developed a 2D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver from scratch in MATLAB to simulate incompressible fluid flow using the Navier-Stokes equations. The solver employs a staggered grid, finite difference discretization, and a fractional step method to decouple velocity and pressure fields.
